# Ports and Adapters Project

## Background

Domain-Driven-Design (DDD) is an architectural design principle of complex enterprise software that aims at seperating a complex problem into components, aka. domains. DDD has other advantages as well and was popularised by Eric Evans' ["blue book"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/) back in 2004. 

To implement a Domain-Driven-Design the so called "hexagonal" pattern (aka "Ports and Adapters" pattern) was [proposed by Alistair Cockburn](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/).

Another source I was relying on so far was [this](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781839211966) more recent book.

## Motivation of this repo

This repo wants to experiment with the design based on a Java Spring implementation. It is meant to be something like a sketch, so please excuse that it has weaknesses (e.g. very limited test cases at this time)

## Stack

* Spring Boot
* Maven
* IDE agnostic (I use IntelliJ Ultimate)
